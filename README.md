# Targeted Advertisement Project (TAP)
## Description
Welcome to the Targeted Advertisement Project (TAP) repository! Our project aims to revolutionize the world of advertisements by creating personalized and relevant ads for specific users. We achieve this by leveraging the power of Langchain and Generative AI, particularly using the GPT model.

By utilizing personal, flight, and weather data, we generate a prompt using an OpenAI model. This prompt serves as the basis for creating a brief, personalized advertisement that resonates with the individual user. To enhance the user experience further, we are also working on implementing image generation, which will complement the generated text.

We believe that targeted advertising can greatly enhance the effectiveness of promotional campaigns while providing users with ads that are genuinely meaningful and tailored to their interests. Through the combination of advanced technologies and data analysis, our project aims to deliver a new level of personalized advertising.
